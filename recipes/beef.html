		<h1>We Will Have A Beef!</h1>

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			The (underrated) hoisin sauce is a thickened, fermented soy-sauce-like
			substance, flavored with chilies, garlic, vinegar, sugar, and, of course,
			exotic spices. It makes a great marinade. And unless you horribly overcook
			it, this skirt steak is juicy and tender.
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 (1 pound) beef skirt steak</li>
			<li>3 tablespoons Chinese vinegar (or sherry vinegar)</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Whisk hoisin sauce, vinegar, soy sauce, hot sauce, sesame oil, grated
				ginger, garlic, brown sugar, salt, and pepper together in a large mixing
				bowl.
			</li>
			<li>
				Cut skirt steak crosswise into about 4 or 5 smaller pieces. Transfer
				steak into marinade and toss until all pieces are evenly coated. Cover
				with plastic wrap. Refrigerate; marinate at least 2 hours and up to 12
				hours.
			</li>
			<li>
				Line a baking pan with paper towels. Transfer pieces of steak to the
				paper towels and mop off some of the marinade.
			</li>
