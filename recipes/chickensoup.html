		<h1>We Will Have A Beef!</h1>
		<img src="images/soup.jfif" width="600" height="500" />
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			This is the traditional recipe made in Greek kitchens. The basic
			Avgolemono (broth and lemon) can be varied for other similar Greek
			recipes. Serve with bread. Bread bits can be dipped into the soup. The
			soup will last in the fridge for a number of days or can be frozen. To
			reheat, place in microwave or heat on the stove.
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken</li>
			<li>Â½ cup uncooked white rice</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Rinse chicken and remove any organs that may be inside. Place in a pot
				large enough for it to move around, but not too big or the broth will be
				watery. Add the chicken neck if that is included with your chicken.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fill the pot with enough water to cover by about 1 inch. Cover and bring
				to a boil. When it boils, reduce heat to low and simmer for 45 minutes
				to 1 hour, skimming the fat from the top as it collects. The meat should
				pull from the bones easily.
			</li>
			<li>Transfer the chicken to a large bowl and set aside to cool.</li>
		</ol>
